## Hi there 👋
My name is Nicolas, known as jn_nicolas or England.

I'm a developer at GameTools and Choriper.

Choriper is my personal solo project, where I do reverse engineering of EA and support my website https://rip-bf.com/

I mainly use Python, PHP, JS, Vue, and a little bit of C, and the .NET Framework for programming.
